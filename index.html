        <p>Welcome to the American Romanticism period, a period characterized by transcendentalism and anti-transcendentalism.</p>
        <p>Two songs that describe this period are High Cotton and Song of the South, both by the band Alabama. Each song has their own page.</p>

        <h2>Anti-Transcendentalism</h2>
        <p>This philosophy believes that humans have the capacity for evil, used gothic elements such as bizarre situations, demonic and insane depictions, and plots about sin, guilt, madness, among others.</p>
